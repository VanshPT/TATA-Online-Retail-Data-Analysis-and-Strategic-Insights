# Online Retail Data Analysis and Strategic Insights

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of an online retail store's data, which I conducted as part of a business consulting project. The project focuses on uncovering actionable insights related to revenue generation, marketing effectiveness, and demographic segmentation. Through a detailed exploration of product categories, customer segments, geographic regions, and sales channels, I aimed to provide strategic recommendations that can help the company optimize its revenue streams and prepare for future growth.

The analysis was built around a real-world dataset of transactional data, showcasing the following capabilities:

- **Revenue Analysis**: Understanding key drivers of revenue by exploring product categories, customer segments, and regions.
